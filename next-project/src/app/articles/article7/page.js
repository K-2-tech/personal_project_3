            <h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
            <p>
              The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves working in focused intervals, typically 25 minutes long, followed by short breaks. This approach helps to maintain concentration, combat procrastination, and improve productivity.

            <p>
              LearnLooper enhances this technique by providing a customizable timer, allowing users to adjust interval lengths to match their unique concentration levels. Whether you're just starting out or are a seasoned learner, this flexibility makes the Pomodoro Technique even more effective.
