        <section className={styles.section}>
          <h2>Chapter 1: The Truth About Learning Revealed by Cognitive Science</h2>
          <h3>1.1 The Physiological Mechanism of Attention</h3>
          <p>
            The human brain has a strong resistance to even starting the learning process. This psychological barrier of "taking the first step" is one of the biggest challenges faced by many learners. The 1-minute timer of LearnLooper is designed precisely to break through this psychological obstacle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The psychological safety of "just 1 minute" provides the initial impetus to take action. While the human brain becomes defensive against large tasks, the resistance to challenging something for an extremely short time is dramatically reduced. The 1-minute time setting cleverly avoids the psychology of "procrastination," which is the greatest enemy when starting to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is based on the "principle of initiation" in psychology. Once an action is started, humans are more likely to continue the activity due to the law of inertia. The 1-minute timer of LearnLooper skillfully utilizes this psychological mechanism, making the first step into learning dramatically easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a neuroscientific perspective, this short time setting instantly stimulates the activity of the prefrontal cortex, activating the systems of concentration and motivation. The "just 1 minute" setting allows the brain to transition into learning mode without feeling an excessive burden.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, many learners find that by overcoming the low barrier of "1 minute," they are often able to concentrate on learning for much longer than expected, sometimes for dozens of minutes or even hours. The initial 1 minute often leads to a productive learning session lasting for a significant duration.
          </p>
          <h3>1.2 The Mechanism of Memory Consolidation</h3>
          <p>
            The spacing effect, a learning theory, demonstrates that short learning sessions are effective for long-term memory. Repeated learning with intervals is known to promote knowledge retention. The flexible timer function of LearnLooper practically implements this principle.

          <h2>Chapter 2: Multimodal Learning Theory</h2>
          <h3>2.1 The Correlation Between Music and Learning</h3>
          <p>
            The influence of music on learning has been scientifically proven. Music promotes the release of dopamine in the brain, enhancing motivation for learning. It has also been shown to reduce stress and improve cognitive performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The YouTube integration feature of LearnLooper is designed based on this scientific knowledge. It provides a personalized learning environment, increases emotional engagement, and forms positive associations with learning.

        <h2>Chapter 3: The Psychology of Behavior Change</h2>
          <h3>3.1 The Power of Small Successes</h3>
          <p>
            The micro-progression theory demonstrates that small achievements can generate significant motivation. The 1-minute timer of LearnLooper can be seen as a tool that embodies this theory. By providing continuous experiences of success, it removes psychological barriers to learning.
